**Human Activity Recognition using ConvLSTM and CNN-LSTM**

**Dataset:** Provided by University of Central Florida

I have used **UCF50 â€“ Action Recognition Dataset**, Provided by **University of Central Florida** which consist of realistic videos taken from youtube which differentiates this data set from most of the other available action recognition data sets as they are not realistic and are staged by actors. The Dataset contains:

**50** Action Categories<br>
**25** Groups of Videos per Action Category<br>
**133** Average Videos per Action Category<br>
**199** Average Number of Frames per Video<br>
**320** Average Frames Width per Video<br>
**240** Average Frames Height per Video<br>
**26** Average Frames Per Seconds per Video<br>
